Certainly! The article by Milan Janosov presents a simple method for finding popular or "hyped" areas in a city, known as hot spots, using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and a technique called DBSCAN clustering. Here’s a simplified breakdown:

Getting Data from OpenStreetMap (OSM): Janosov starts by collecting data on Points of Interest (POIs) like cafes, bars, and yoga studios from OpenStreetMap for Budapest. These POIs are chosen because they're associated with a trendy, modern lifestyle.

Clustering with DBSCAN: Next, the data is organized using DBSCAN, a method that groups nearby POIs together into clusters. This helps identify areas with a high concentration of these trendy places, indicating a hot spot.

Visualizing the Data: The article then shows how to visualize these clusters on a map, making it easy to see where the hot spots are in Budapest. This is done first with a simple plot and then with an interactive map using a tool called Folium.

Analyzing the Clusters: Janosov analyzes the clusters to understand their characteristics, such as the diversity of POIs in each cluster. This is done by looking at the types of POIs in each cluster and measuring their variety.

Identifying Unique Hot Spots: Finally, the method identifies which clusters are truly unique or specialized by comparing the types of POIs in each cluster to the overall distribution. This helps understand what makes each hot spot distinct.

In essence, the article shows a straightforward way to use freely available data and some coding to find and understand trendy areas in a city. It’s about finding where the cool, lively spots are by looking at what kinds of places gather together, all without needing to be an expert in data analysis.

i want do do similar research with transport data, to understand the quality of areas

To conduct research similar to Milan Janosov's approach but focusing on transport data to understand the quality of areas, you can follow a structured framework. This research will involve identifying areas with high-quality transport options by analyzing data from sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM) or other transport datasets. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored for transport data analysis:

1. Define Objectives
Start by clearly defining what you mean by "quality of areas" in terms of transport. Are you looking at the availability of public transport options (buses, trams, metro), the density of transport nodes, connectivity, or accessibility to key services via public transport?

2. Data Collection
OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data: Use OSM or similar datasets to collect data on transport-related POIs (Points of Interest). This includes bus stops, metro stations, bike-sharing stations, etc.
APIs and Other Datasets: Consider using APIs from local transport authorities or datasets available from city planning departments to get updated and comprehensive transport data.
3. Data Preparation
Filter and Clean Data: Once you have the transport data, filter it based on your research objectives. Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies or irrelevant entries.
Geospatial Data Conversion: Convert your data into a GeoDataFrame to facilitate spatial analysis. This involves assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to each transport-related POI.
4. Spatial Clustering with DBSCAN
Apply DBSCAN Clustering: Use DBSCAN from the sklearn library to cluster the transport data. Adjust the eps parameter to control the spatial extent of clusters, effectively grouping together areas with high transport node density.
Analyze Clusters: After clustering, identify clusters with high densities of transport options. These clusters can be considered as areas with potentially higher transport quality.
5. Visualization
Map Visualization: Use tools like Folium to create interactive maps that highlight your clusters. This visual representation will help you easily identify areas with better transport options.
Cluster Attributes Visualization: Consider visualizing attributes of each cluster, such as the types of transport options available, their frequency, and coverage.
6. Quality Analysis
Evaluate Transport Quality: Based on the clusters identified, evaluate the quality of transport in each area. Consider factors like diversity of transport modes, coverage, accessibility, and proximity to key destinations.
Cross-reference with Other Data: To get a comprehensive understanding of transport quality, cross-reference your findings with other datasets, such as traffic congestion data, travel time data, and user satisfaction surveys.
7. Conclusions and Recommendations
Summarize your findings on the quality of transport in different areas. Provide recommendations for improving transport services based on your analysis. Highlight areas that require more transport options or improvements in existing services.

Tools and Technologies
Python Libraries: Use Python for data analysis, with libraries like pandas for data manipulation, geopandas for geospatial analysis, matplotlib and Folium for visualization, and sklearn for DBSCAN clustering.
GIS Software: For more advanced spatial analysis, consider using GIS software like QGIS.
Final Thoughts
This research can help city planners, transport authorities, and policymakers understand current transport dynamics and make informed decisions to enhance urban mobility. By analyzing transport data through spatial clustering, you can uncover insights into the effectiveness of the existing transport infrastructure and identify areas where improvements are needed.
